#ReactiveDemo-iOS
=============

**IMPORTANT:** Never open ReactiveDemo-iOS.xcodeproj - it will not work since CocoaPods depends on usage of **ReactiveDemo-iOS.xcworkspace**, which is generated by CocoaPods with links to all dependencies (pods).

## Getting started
  
    # 1. Install or update cocoa pods

    # Install from scratch, requires RubyGems (http://rubygems.org/)
    $ [sudo] gem install cocoapods

    # Update to latest version, at time of writing I am using 0.33.1
    $ [sudo] gem update cocoapods


    # 2. Update repo of pods
    $ pod repo update


    # 3. Clone
    $ git clone git@github.com:snezdoliy/reactive-demo.git
    $ cd ReactiveDemo-iOS

    
    # 4. Installs pods that project depends on
    $ pod install


    # 5. Open newly created workspace file:
    $ open ReactiveDemo-iOS.xcworkspace
